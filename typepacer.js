But, on the other hand, don't stress too much about having few errors. That may reduce your speed as well.",
        "When making a typing test, it is important to use many different texts to make the test. If the user is allowed to type the same sentence many times over, then it is inevitable that their speed will trend upwards, and the test will slowly become less and less accurate.",
        "I've always wondered just how many different quotes can be typed on different typing test sites. Will I ever type a repeat quote? Have I already done so, without realizing it?",
        "It's likely that if you have used this site for any reasonable amount of time, this is not the first time you have typed this quote. It's not like there are that many quotes to choose from. That would take a lot of work to gather that many quotes.",

        "The current world population is about 7.6 billion. This figure would appear to mark a certain point in time, such that if someone wanted to, they could track the approximate time that I typed this. But, a number like that could mark many points, from past to future.",
        "This quote is very long, and may not be particularly pleasant to type. But, these typing tests are all a little inaccurate, in that they all give a short quote to type. It wouldn't be fun to type a whole page or two just to get some results, but in the real world, typing papers and long documents is what typing is generally used for. Online typing tests are like 50 meter sprints, but in reality we're trying to prepare ourselves for a marathon. So why not make the typing tests require some endurance, as well? It might do us some good."
